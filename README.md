Project 1 CS 50

I have completed steps the PostgreSQL section for the project. I have downloaded Python and Flask for SQLALchemy purposes I have completed GoogleReadsAPI and it is part of my file equestgoodreads.py I was able to import books.csv dataset with import.py

For my website, I have a layout.html for my webpage template For the requirements, I created Registration file under registration.html I have website templates such as error.html, success.html

I also have my website "books page" that list out the books. It is part of the application.py file   When I submit "flask run", at http://127.0.0.1:5000/  I get to see the registration page,  http://127.0.0.1:5000/books I was able to see the books list of title and author,  http://127.0.0.1:5000/index also works, which user get to rate the dop down book list with a scale from 1 to 5, there is also a form for user to write review here. Then user can click submit and everything will be saved (I try to do this but it is not working so well after I click submit). I was able to create a form for user to submit the reviews, but there is something wrong with the url server connection My API Acess is part of the application.py, I am confident I set them up well, yet because of coupld steps from above that did not work, which generating not working link. However, when I dont connect them with previous steps, it does show up.

I appreciate this class very much. I am not good at it but I have learned a lot of new things from this class.
